## Lab Question Answers

Question 1: 

Answer: I feel as though it would be ideal to offload tasks onto my PC if the task is too intensive for my raspberry pi. In general, the tasks given to us in this lab are not very intensive, so in theory we can just do it all on the rapsberry pi, but ultimately sending to my computer will be faster, but if my computer is far away and the size of the input data cannot be sent in one post request, offloading the data might not be worth it and it might take longer to actually send the data than computing it.

Question 2: 

Answer: We have 1 thread running on server and 1 running on main. We must use thread join to join these two processes running on differing threads so that the final_process call can be called.

Question 3: 

Answer: These processes are running concurrently as parallel refers to the same system being able to execute multiple tasks at the same time, while concurrently is asynchronous meaning when handling multiple tasks which means that threading is concurrent.

Question 4: 

Answer: Based on the graph, it is very likely that when you do outsource both processes to your local machine, it is significantly faster than doing any or all processes on the pi.

Question 5: 

Answer: It is obvious that it is NONE

Question 6: 

Answer: I have worked on projects where the computation is so intensive such as during machine learning calculations or AI training which requires offloading to a server which is made to handle large and huge processes like this.
